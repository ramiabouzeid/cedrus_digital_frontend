A login form [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login)
A create movie form [http://localhost:3000/createMovie](http://localhost:3000/createMovie), the movies are now loaded from youtube based on specific video ids, they might not work due to youtube policy and integration.

## Apis
I used crudcrud.com which is a paid service, where I am creating users and logging them in, in case the data fails to load please do contact me to extend the plan

## Remarks
### Git
I usually work on a feature branch with the ticket number, and after finishing it I create a pull request to be reviewed and then merged on dev, this was not done currently due to the lack of time
### Api
I had an issue with the api which took me a while to fix which needed a subscription and a payment
